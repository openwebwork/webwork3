# Handling Permissions or Roles

In seems that this restructuring gives us the opportunity
to rethink the handling of permissions and roles.  Instead
of a numerical value of the roles, we can build a table of
permissions and tasks (or sets of functions) that each role
can employ.

## Permissions

A permission is the allowance of function calls. For example,
allow to create a homework set.  These are typically
database-level structures

## Tasks

Tasks are things to be done.  Record a submission is an example.

## Roles

A role will be a set of permissions and tasks.

### Current Roles  (Group of Permssions)

- Guest
- Student
- login_proctor
- grade_proctor
- TA
- professor
- admin

### Ability to create other roles

If the default roles do not apply, there should be the flexibility
to create other roles that will have permissions and tasks.

### Storage

The role needs to be stored as a lookup table of permissions and
tasks.   It's unclear if this needs to be in the database or config
files.
