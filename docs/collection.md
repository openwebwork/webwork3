# Collections in WeBWorK

This is a data structure that is a bunch of problems.  There are a
number of existing structures that fall into this:

- HomeworkSet
- GatewayQuiz
- ProctoredGatewayQuiz
- JITAR set
- showMeAnother (?)

Each one of these is separate although there is some common structure.
If we create an`ProblemSet` class, then each of these can inherit a
lot of the structure from the top class.

This will also allow the generation of other structures more easily
including

## New Collections

- ProblemPool: a set of problems that other collections can pull from
- ReviewSet: a set of problems that isn't scored and can be done randomly.
- Quiz: A more-simple-than the gateway quiz,  timed quiz

## AbstractProblemSet

Common properties/methods:

- set of problems
- `addProblem`
- `deleteProblem`

### Homework Set

- the problems are sequential
- mapping between the order and the set.

### ProblemPool

- `getRandomProblem`
