  doc: Mode in which the LANG and DIR settings for a single problem are determined.
  doc2: >
    Mode in which the LANG and DIR settings for a single problem are determined.

    The system will set the LANGuage attribute to either a value determined from the problem,
    a course-wide default, or the system default of en-US, depending on the mode selected.
    The tag will only be added to the DIV enclosing the problem if it is different than the
    value which should be set in the main HTML tag set for the entire course based on the
    course language.<p>There are two options for the DIRection attribute: \"ltr\" for
    left-to-write sripts, and \"rtl\" for right-to-left scripts like Arabic and Hebrew.

    The DIRection attribute is needed to trigger proper display of the question text when
    the problem text-direction is different than that used by the current language of the
    course. For example, English problems from the library browser would display improperly
    in RTL mode for a Hebrew course, unless the problen Direction is set to LTR.<p>The feature
    to set a problem language and direction was only added in 2018 to the PG language, so most
    problems will not declare their language, and the system needs to fall back to determining
    the language and direction in a different manner. The OPL itself is all English, so the
    system wide fallback is to en-US in LTR mode.<p>Since the defaults fall back to the LTR
    direction, most sites should be fine with the \"auto::\" mode, but may want to select the
    one which matches their course language. The mode \"force::ltr\" would also be an option
    for a course which runs into trouble with the \"auto\" modes.<p>Modes:

    <ul><li> \"none\"
    prevents any additional LANG and/or DIR tag being added. The browser will use the main setting
    which was applied to the entire HTML page. This is likely to cause trouble when a problem of
    the other direction is displayed.</li><li> \"auto::\" allows the system to make the settings
    based on the language and direction reported by the problem (a new feature, so not set in
    almost all existing problems) and falling back to the expected default of en-US in LTR mode. </li>

    <li> \"auto:LangCode:Dir\" allows the system to make the settings based on the language and direction
    reported by the problem (a new feature, so not set in almost all existing problems) but falling
    back to the language with the given LangCode and the direction Dir when problem settings are not
    available from PG.</li>

    <li> \"auto::Dir\" for problems without PG settings, this will use the
    default en=english language, but force the direction to Dir. Problems with PG settings will get
    those settings.</li>

    <li> \"auto:LangCode:\" for problems without PG settings, this will use the
    default LTR direction, but will set the language to LangCode.Problems with PG settings will get
    those settings.</li>

    <li> \"force:LangCode:Dir\" will <b>ignore</b> any setting made by the PG
    code of the problem, and will force the system to set the language with the given LangCode and
    the direction to Dir for <b>all</b> problems.</li>

    <li> \"force::Dir\" will <b>ignore</b> any
    setting made by the PG code of the problem, and will force the system to set the direction to Dir
    for <b>all</b> problems, but will avoid setting any language attribute for individual problem.</li></ul>

  doc2: >
    After the Reduced Scoring Date all additional work done by the student
    counts at a reduced rate. Here is where you set the reduced rate which
    must be a percentage. For example if this value is 50% and a student
    views a problem during the Reduced Scoring Period, they will see the message
    "You are in the Reduced Scoring Period: All additional work done counts 50%
    of the original."

    To use this, you also have to enable Reduced Scoring and set the Reduced
    Scoring Date for individual assignments by editing the set data using the
    Hmwk Sets Editor.

    This works with the avg_problem_grader (which is
    the default grader) and the std_problem_grader (the all or nothing grader).
    It will work with custom graders if they are written appropriately.

    the Reduced Scoring is enabled and if it is after the reduced scoring date, but
    before the due date, a message like "This assignment has a Reduced Scoring
    Period that begins 11/08/2009 at 06:17pm EST and ends on the due date, 11/10/2009
